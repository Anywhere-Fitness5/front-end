This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` to begin the application.

Instructors can log in with the instructor code which is '123'. If the code 123 is entered; then the login navigates you to the instructor dashboard; where you can create and delete classes.

Logins that don't have a code; or don't have the correct code will automatically be taken to the client dashboard. The client dashboard allows the clients to view their current classes; and decide which ones to zoom into.

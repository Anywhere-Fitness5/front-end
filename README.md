# Anywhere Fitness
Work out anytime, anywhere. This application solves the problem of gyms being closed by allowing fitness instructors to host virtual classes so that clients can sign up and participate.

All users of the app can register and log in, but there are separate dashboards for instuctors and their clients.
Instructors are users with special permissions - they can add, edit, and delete class cards. (The default instructor code is '123').
Users can sign up for classes by adding them to their class list, and they can delete classes from their list.
